## PROJECT IDEA

My project track is "Education" . It is a
website which provides six different
functions that can help students with their
studies ,increase concentration and promote
productivity. It includes four different
playlists , listening time of each is different
,music genre is also different that is proven
to promote focus and memorization.

## SERVICES

Pomodoro Timer :The Pomodoro timer provides  work periods with  breaks in between. This method is one of the best study methods and keeps up your motivation, improves productivity, and ensures you do not strain yourself.

Flash Cards: These customizable flashcards are easy to make and efficient to use. They will help you memorize anything you need to know.

Melody: It includes four different playlists i.e
related to concentration , listening time
of each is different ,music genre is also
different that is proven to promote focus
and memorization

Calculator: An easy access calculator for all your calculating needs.

Text to Speech (TTS): It is scientifically proven that audial learning can help you learn and memorize more than just reading it. Not only that, but you can multitask and complete other things while listening to your text being read to you.

Speech to Text (STT) :This function will print out everything it hears. Instead of typing, you can just say what you want to write and the computer will write it for you!. You can also leave it on during a lecture to have a transcript of the lesson for future reference.

## PROBLEM IT SOLVED?

As nowadays mostly students even adults do feel the problem of lack of
concentration during study.
So I made a platform on which people can use different features which
will helps them to increase their focus and concentration which will
automatically increase their productivity.
Also due to covid students have faced a lot of difficulties in learning and
the biggest problem is for the physically impaired children as it would
become difficult for them to learn behind a screen so this website also
has feature of text to speech and speech to text for them too.

## What's next for Minare

I am also thing to add a blog page too so that the students who benefitted from this website will about  their experience and motivate others
